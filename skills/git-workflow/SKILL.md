# Git Workflow Skill

Modular git workflow management using Conventional Commits and GitHub Flow.

## Available Workflows

| Task | File | When to Use |
|------|------|-------------|
| Create PR | `create-pr.md` | Creating a new pull request with proper description |
| Review Comments | `review-comments.md` | Fetching, triaging, and addressing PR feedback |
| Commits | `commit-workflow.md` | Writing conventional commits, staging, amending |
| Branches | `branch-management.md` | Creating, naming, and cleaning up branches |
| Merging | `merge-workflow.md` | Merge strategies, conflict resolution, cleanup |
| Changelog | `add-changelog.md` | Setting up or updating a project changelog |
| Address PR Comments | `gh-address-comments.md` | Handle PR review/issue comments with gh CLI |
| Fix CI | `gh-fix-ci.md` | Inspect failing PR checks and plan fixes |

## Quick Reference

**Conventional Commit Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`

**Branch Prefixes:** `feature/`, `fix/`, `hotfix/`

**PR Type Prefixes:** `[Feature]`, `[Fix]`, `[Refactor]`, `[Perf]`, `[Docs]`, `[Test]`, `[Build]`, `[BREAKING]`

## Safety Rules (Always Active)

- Never force push to main/master/release branches without explicit confirmation.
- Never delete remote branches without confirmation.
- Never skip hooks (--no-verify) unless explicitly asked.
- Prefer creating new commits over amending shared commits.
- Before any destructive operation: state what will happen and ask for confirmation.
